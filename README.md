# Cpp algorithm exercise

This repository contains a collection of challenging **C++ algorithmic exercises** exploring various **search, backtracking, and logic-solving techniques**.  
Each subproject focuses on a different type of problem, from word-based puzzles to spatial routing and encoding challenges.

### 🧠 Categories

#### 🔤 Word & String Puzzles
`doublets`, `soundex`, `scrabble`, `palindrome`, `solitaire`, `gogen`  
Exercises involving word transformations, lexical constraints, or pattern-based string analysis.

#### 🧭 Pathfinding & Logic Routing
`laser`, `sokoban`  
Grid-based or geometric puzzles emphasizing movement planning, reflection logic, or obstacle navigation.

#### 🔐 Encoding & Pattern Reasoning
`stamp`  
Symbolic reasoning and encoding/decoding problems requiring constraint satisfaction and combinatorial search.
