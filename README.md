# Cpp algorithm exercise

This repository contains a collection of challenging **C++ algorithmic exercises** exploring various **search, backtracking, and logic-solving techniques**. Each subproject focuses on a different type of problem, from word-based puzzles to spatial routing and encoding challenges.

---

### Categories

- **Word & String Puzzles:** `doublets`, `soundex`, `scrabble`, `palindrome`, `solitaire`, `gogen`. Exercises involving word transformations, lexical constraints, or pattern-based string analysis.

- **Pathfinding & Logic Routing:** `laser`, `sokoban`. Grid-based or geometric puzzles emphasizing movement planning, reflection logic, or obstacle navigation.

- **Encoding & Pattern Reasoning:** `stamp`. Symbolic reasoning and encoding/decoding problems requiring constraint satisfaction and combinatorial search.
